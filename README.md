# Sentiment-analysis-using-Sequence-models
In this notebook we will apply different sequence architectures starting from RNN, LSTM, GRU, and bi directional RNN to predict the sentiment associated to a sentence. 

An open source UCI dataset is used to train the model link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences


# Steps to run
1. Download the dataset 
2. For the current model training we are only using imdb.txt file 
3. Change the file path to point to the txt file path
4. Run the notebook

*LSTM / GRU networks will have a better performance on the test set
